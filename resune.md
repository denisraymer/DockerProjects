I have been engaged in development since 2016 and have specialized in Frontend development since 2018.
I am interested in web application architecture, workflow organization, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps practices.

I have experience in developing and maintaining web applications using React, Redux, and TypeScript. I am proficient in
adaptive and cross-browser layout (HTML5, CSS3, SASS/SCSS, BEM) and work with task managers such as Gulp and Webpack. I

I administer cloud services in AWS and Yandex Cloud, work with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes. I am familiar
with Linux, Proxmox, and Jenkins.
